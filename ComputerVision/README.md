#ComputerVision
Sam Booth

Short Description
This project uses a Kinect and LeapMotion controller and outputs whatever is in front of the camera using different meshes. Depending on how your hands are positioned, the mesh changes or you can zoom in and out of the mesh. 

Motivation
In the modern world, humans stare at computers to look at the output on the screen. This project strives to make people think about what the computer sees when it looks back at you. Is the computer it's own entity that can 'see'? How can our paradigm of what a computer does change when answering this question? I believe the power of interactions with machines is much larger than we think possible today.

Build Instructions
Addons: ofxKinect, ofxOpenCV, ofxLeapMotion2
Once these addons are loaded, and the Kinect and LeapMotion controller are connected, simply run the project

Usage Instructions
Your left hand controls which type of mesh is being used on the y axis. Your right hand controls the zoom on the z axis.
